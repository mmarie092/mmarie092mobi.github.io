      <p>Cats are excellent pets. They are loving, cuddly, curious, creatures. But what if being anywhere near a feline makes you miserable? Sneezing, itchy eyes, and difficulty breathing can cause any cat lover to pump the breaks on bringing a furry cuddle-bug home. </p>
       
<br>

      <h3 style="text-align:center">What Makes us Allergic to Cats?</h3>
        <p>We often think that a cat's fur is what causes allergy flare-ups, but it is actually the proteins they produce. The most widely known protein is called Fel D 1, and it is in their dander and saliva. </p>
       
<br>

      <h3 style="text-align:center">What is a Hypoallergenic Cat?</h3>
      <p>The word, "hypoallergenic" refers to something that is less likely to cause an allergic reaction than something else of a similar nature. When we talk about hypoallergenic cats, we are referring to certain breeds of cats that produce less of the Fel D 1 protein. While this certainly sounds like good news to those who suffer from cat allergies, keep in mind that these cats can still cause flare-ups. 
       </p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center">But I Still Want a Cat! What Can I Do?</h3>
